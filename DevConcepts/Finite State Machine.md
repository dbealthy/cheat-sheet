> **State** - "snapshot" of an object at any given time.

> **Transition** - change from one state to another.

*Mathematical concept that describes an abstract machine that can be in exactly one or finite number of states at any given time. FSM can change state from one to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition.
An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition*


Finite-state machines are of two types: 
- **Deterministic finite state machines** - can lead to one different state only
- **Non-deterministic finite-state machines** - finite state machines are finite state machines where a given input from a particular state can lead to **more than one** different state.
